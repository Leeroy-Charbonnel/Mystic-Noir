Master of disguise who can alter his appearance, voice, and mannerisms to blend into any environment from high society gatherings to dockyard taverns.

He possesses detailed knowledge of Crescent City's architecture including forgotten tunnels and passages from the Prohibition era, allowing him to move throughout the city unseen. The theft of the Dupont Heirloom represents the culmination of years of planning, as it contains documentation of his bloodline and legal claim to part of the family fortune. Despite his quest for recognition and justice, he struggles with what he will do if he succeeds - his identity as The Shadow has become more real to him than his birth name after so many years of deception.
