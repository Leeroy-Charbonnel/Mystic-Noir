Oval-shaped, approximately 2 inches in length, with intricate filigree work surrounding a central emerald (the Dupont family stone). The front displays the Dupont family crest in relief - an oak tree with three stars above. The interior appears to be a simple double-frame for miniature portraits, but contains a hidden compartment accessible only by pressing the emerald in a specific sequence. The locket hangs on an ornate gold chain that has been repaired several times throughout its history, each repair marking a significant family event.
