When the operation went wrong, Lily was caught in crossfire and killed instantly. Samuel still experiences vivid flashbacks of that moment, especially during rainfall (it was raining that night). Though he managed to wound Monrose in the firefight, the evidence was destroyed and Monrose escaped conviction. Michael Moore, Lily's father, has never forgiven Samuel though they occasionally cross paths due to Moore remaining on the force. Samuel's quest to finally bring Monrose to justice drives many of his actions, though he keeps this obsession carefully hidden. He visits Lily's grave monthly, leaving small tokens and updates on his progress against Monrose. His office doubles as living quarters during intense cases, and he rarely returns to his sparsely furnished apartment.","type":"textarea"}}}}
