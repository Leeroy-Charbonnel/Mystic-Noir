Locations","name":"Stardust Lounge","contentType":"","template":{"BasicInformation":{"Name":{"value":"The Stardust Lounge","type":"text"},"location":{"value":"317 Riverside Boulevard, Wharf District, Crescent City","type":"text"}},"Appearance":{"Description":{"value":"From the outside, an unassuming three-story brick building with minimal signage - just a small brass plaque bearing an art deco star design beside a heavy wooden door guarded by two well-dressed but intimidating doormen. Inside reveals an unexpectedly spacious establishment spanning the entire building, with the main lounge on the ground floor, private gambling rooms on the second, and exclusive members-only areas on the third. The main lounge features a large circular bar at center, surrounded by intimate seating arrangements of velvet-upholstered booths and small tables. A stage at one end showcases nightly jazz performances, while the opposite wall features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the river, their views partially obscured by strategically placed ornamental screens. Art deco styling throughout features dark woods, brass accents, and the celestial motif that gives the lounge its name - most dramatically in the midnight-blue ceiling embedded with hundreds of tiny lights resembling stars.","type":"textarea"},"Detail":{"value":"The lounge carefully balances luxury with discretion. The main bar is crafted from rare African mahogany, topped with Italian marble, and staffed by bartenders as skilled at keeping secrets as mixing drinks. Private booths along the perimeter are designed with acoustics that prevent conversations from carrying, each with a small brass service button to summon staff without interruption. The stage features state-of-the-art sound equipment disguised within vintage-appearing components, and is backed by a shimmering beaded curtain that parts to reveal featured performers. The second floor contains various gaming rooms offering everything from poker and roulette to more exotic gambling options, each room themed after a constellation. The third floor, accessible only by private elevator with key card access, contains ultra-exclusive meeting rooms and a members-only cigar lounge rumored to be where the city's most important deals are negotiated. Throughout the establishment, strategic mirrors allow staff (and owner Victor Monrose) to monitor activities while appearing merely decorative. Behind the main building lies a private courtyard with a separate entrance for VIPs and service deliveries, carefully shielded from street view.","type":"textarea"}},"Atmosphere":{"Description":{"value":"The Stardust cultivates an atmosphere of sophisticated danger and exclusive indulgence. The air is laced with cigarette smoke, top-shelf liquor, expensive perfumes, and the occasional hint of illicit substances in the private rooms. Sound is carefully managed - the main lounge maintains a perfect balance where the excellent jazz performers can be appreciated while still allowing conversation, while private areas are sound-dampened to ensure confidentiality. Lighting is deliberately dim and flattering, with tables illuminated by small lamps creating pools of warm light that make everyone feel isolated from neighboring tables despite the open floor plan. The overall mood shifts throughout the night - early evenings bring business discussions and networking among Crescent City's elite, while after midnight the atmosphere turns more hedonistic as inhibitions lower and the true nature of the establishment emerges. Staff members maintain perfect professionalism regardless of what they witness, contributing to patrons' sense that normal rules and consequences are suspended within these walls.","type":"textarea"}},"AssociatedCharacters":{"value":["Victor Monrose - owner and shadow ruler of Crescent City's criminal enterprises","Eliza Crane - headline singer whose performances draw the elite while her ears collect valuable information","Marcus Reed - head bartender who knows everyone's preferred poison and hidden vices","Dominic Vesley - floor manager and Monrose's enforcer, elegant but deadly","Samantha Wells - hostess who controls access and remembers every face and name","Various staff, performers, high-rollers, and underworld figures"],"type":"array:text"},"AdditionalNotes":{"value":"The Stardust originated during Prohibition as a genuine speakeasy, then transformed into a legitimate business while maintaining its connections to Crescent City's underworld.

The establishment operates with minimal interference from authorities due to Monrose's extensive connections with corrupt officials, many of whom enjoy the lounge's amenities as his guests.\n\nEntrance requires either membership (by invitation only) or being on the nightly guest list maintained by Samantha.
