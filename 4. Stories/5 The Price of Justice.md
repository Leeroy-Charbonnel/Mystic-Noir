Samuel, who has seen his share of violence during both his police career and military service in the war, is visibly shaken by the sight of the child's small form.

When he questions Emily's friends, he learns they were playing near the mayor's residence the day before she disappeared, and Emily had mentioned seeing something \\\"grown-up and scary\\\" through a basement window.\\n\\nAfter only three days of investigation, Samuel's supervisor, Captain Monroe, pressures him to close the case by pinning the murder on a local drifter with a history of mental illness who was seen in the area.
