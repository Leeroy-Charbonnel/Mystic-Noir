          - "<h3>Part 1: A Case Arrives </h3><p><strong>Setting: [[Samuel's Office]]</strong></p><p>A messy desk, an ashtray full of ashes. Smoke hangs in the air. A dead plant in the corner. A glass of cognac and a half-empty bottle sit on a small cabinet. A wide shot shows [[Samuel Blackwood]] sitting at his desk, looking through the venetian blinds. The only light comes from the window, casting striped shadows on the walls and through the cigar smoke rising from the ashtray. His desk is cluttered. A closer shot of the same scene: we see through the blinds, framing the image. From [[Samuel Blackwood]]'s point of view, we see the street below. His office is on the third floor. A black car is parked outside. A chauffeur in a neat uniform holds the door open. A woman steps out—elegant, dressed in expensive clothes. A close-up of [[Samuel Blackwood]]'s hand picking up his cigar from the ashtray. Ashes are scattered around it. The office door opens, and [[Evelyn Dupont]] stands in the doorway, her posture perfect, her eyes surveying the cramped office with a mixture of distaste and determination. [[Samuel Blackwood]] rises to greet her, hiding his surprise at having such a distinguished visitor. She explains her situation with measured words, revealing that she fears her family heirloom will be targeted by \"[[The Shadow]]\" a notorious thief who has been plaguing the city's elite.</p>"
          - "<h3><strong>Part 2: The Heirloom and Its Secrets</strong></h3><p><strong>Setting: [[Dupont's Mansion]]</strong></p><p>Lavish rooms filled with antiques and paintings. Security measures are visible but discreet. The heirloom sits in a glass display case in the study. [[Samuel Blackwood]] visits [[Dupont's Mansion]] to inspect the security and see the [[Dupont's Heirloom]] for himself. [[Evelyn Dupont]] guides him through rooms of opulence, speaking of her family's history and the importance of the heirloom. However, [[Samuel Blackwood]] notices inconsistencies in her story, subtle tensions when certain topics arise. Examining the heirloom, he senses there's more to the artifact than mere monetary value. When he questions [[Evelyn Dupont]] more directly about why \"[[The Shadow]]\" would target this specific item, she becomes evasive, claiming it's merely due to its value. His instincts tell him she's hiding something significant. Before leaving, [[Samuel Blackwood]] discreetly interviews some of the household staff, gathering information about [[Evelyn Dupont]]'s routines, recent visitors, and any unusual occurrences. One elderly servant reluctantly mentions that Mrs. Dupont has been retrieving old family documents from storage and spending long hours alone in her study.</p>"
          - "<h3>Part 3: Into the Underworld</h3><p><strong>Setting: [[Stardust Lounge]]</strong></p><p>A smoky, jazzy atmosphere. Well-dressed patrons gamble and drink while deals are made in shadowy corners. The line between high society and criminal element blurs. To learn more about \"[[The Shadow]]\" [[Samuel Blackwood]] visits [[Stardust Lounge]], a known gathering place for both the criminal underworld and the city's elite. Using old contacts and strategic bribes, he navigates the establishment, listening for whispers about the notorious thief. In a private booth, he meets an informant who shares rumors about \"[[The Shadow]]\" targeting items with historical significance rather than just monetary value. The conversation is interrupted when [[Samuel Blackwood]] spots a familiar face—[[Evelyn Dupont]]'s chauffeur, speaking intensely with a known fence of stolen goods. Following the chauffeur, [[Samuel Blackwood]] witnesses a clandestine exchange of information. When confronted, the chauffeur attempts to flee but is cornered. He reveals that [[Evelyn Dupont]] hasn't been entirely forthcoming—she and \"[[The Shadow]]\" have a past connection, and the heirloom contains something more valuable than anyone realizes.</p>"
          - "<h3>Part 4: The Theft and Revelation</h3><p><strong>Setting: [[Dupont's Mansion]] and [[Samuel's Office]]</strong></p><p>Night time, a storm brewing. Security systems disabled. The empty display case where the heirloom once sat. Despite [[Samuel Blackwood]]'s precautions, the [[Dupont's Heirloom]] is stolen. The theft is executed with remarkable precision—no evidence, no witnesses, just an empty display case discovered in the morning. [[Evelyn Dupont]] is distraught, but [[Samuel Blackwood]] detects something performative in her reaction. Back at his office, [[Samuel Blackwood]] reviews all the information he's gathered. Piecing together fragments of conversations and clues, he realizes the truth: [[Evelyn Dupont]] orchestrated the theft herself to draw out \"[[The Shadow]]\" who is not just a thief but someone from her past with a legitimate claim to the heirloom—possibly a disinherited relative or former lover seeking justice. The heirloom itself contains evidence of a long-buried family scandal that could ruin the Dupont name. By staging this elaborate scheme, [[Evelyn Dupont]] hoped to identify and eliminate the threat to her family's reputation once and for all.</p>"
          - "<h3>Part 5: Confrontation and Choice</h3><p><strong>Setting: An abandoned Dupont family property on the outskirts of the city</strong></p><p>Decrepit grandeur, dust-covered furniture, moonlight streaming through broken windows. [[Samuel Blackwood]] tracks \"[[The Shadow]]\" to an abandoned Dupont property, where he finds [[Evelyn Dupont]] already present. The confrontation reveals the full truth: \"[[The Shadow]]\" is [[Evelyn Dupont]]'s illegitimate half-brother, written out of the family history and denied his birthright. The heirloom contains proof of his claim—a hidden compartment with documents and a portrait miniature. [[Evelyn Dupont]] pleads with [[Samuel Blackwood]] to help her maintain the family secret, offering substantial payment. \"[[The Shadow]]\" counters with an appeal to [[Samuel Blackwood]]'s sense of justice. [[Samuel Blackwood]] must make a choice: help maintain the Dupont family's prestigious façade or expose decades of deception and allow justice for \"[[The Shadow]].\" In the end, his decision reflects his complex moral code—he arranges a private resolution between the siblings, ensuring neither complete victory nor total defeat for either party, while keeping the most damaging secrets from public view.</p>"
