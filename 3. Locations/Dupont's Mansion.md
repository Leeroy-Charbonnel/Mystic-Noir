The three-story white stone structure features towering Corinthian columns supporting a grand portico, with symmetrical wings extending on either side. The mansion boasts over 20 rooms, including a grand ballroom, library, conservatory, and numerous bedrooms and sitting rooms.

The grand foyer features imported Italian marble flooring and a sweeping double staircase. The main level includes formal dining and reception rooms decorated with antique furniture, ancestral portraits, and art collected across generations. The library houses rare first editions behind glass cases and features a secret door disguised as a bookshelf leading to a private study where family documents are kept. The second floor contains the family bedrooms, including Evelyn's suite with its private sitting room and balcony overlooking the rose garden. The third floor, originally servants' quarters, now houses rarely-used guest rooms and storage spaces containing trunks of family heirlooms. The basement level includes the wine cellar, modern security room monitoring the estate, and a vault built during Prohibition that now stores valuables including (until recently) the Dupont Legacy Locket. Throughout the mansion, certain rooms remain unchanged for decades, while others have been subtly modernized to provide contemporary comfort while maintaining historic appearance.","type":"textarea"}},"Atmosphere":{"Description":{"value":"The estate projects an aura of timeless elegance and carefully preserved tradition. Sounds are muted by thick walls and heavy draperies, creating a hushed atmosphere where every footstep echoes slightly on marble floors or is absorbed by antique Persian carpets. The air carries subtle scents of beeswax polish, fresh flowers always present in the main rooms, and the lingering notes of Evelyn's signature perfume. Natural light filters through tall windows during the day, while evenings bring the warm glow of crystal chandeliers and antique lamps. Despite its beauty, the mansion possesses a certain coldness - rooms feel staged rather than lived in, and there's a tangible sense of being observed, whether by the stern-faced ancestors in oil paintings or the discreet security cameras hidden among architectural details. The overall impression is one of preserved perfection that simultaneously impresses visitors and keeps them at a distance.","type":"textarea"}},"AssociatedCharacters":{"value":["Evelyn Dupont - current mistress of the estate","Martinez Family - longtime household staff (Maria - housekeeper, Carlos - groundskeeper, Sofia - Evelyn's personal maid)","Thomas Jenkins - Security director and former police officer","Various household staff (additional maids, cook, chauffeur)","The Shadow - intimately familiar with the mansion's layout from childhood and subsequent surveillance"],"type":"array:text"},"AdditionalNotes":{"value":"The mansion serves as both showcase and fortress for the Dupont family legacy. Its grandeur masks several secrets, including concealed passages dating to Prohibition when the family allegedly had connections to rum-running. The security system has been extensively upgraded since The Shadow's theft of the family heirloom, with new motion sensors, enhanced camera coverage, and additional guards patrolling the grounds at night.
