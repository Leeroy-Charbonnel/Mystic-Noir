- **Occupation:** Master Thief  
- **Background:** Born into poverty but possessing exceptional intelligence and dexterity, The Shadow rose to become one of the most elusive thieves in Crescent City. Specializes in seemingly impossible heists, targeting the wealthy elite with a particular focus on items of historical significance rather than just monetary value.

- **Hair:** Black, kept neatly trimmed when in public disguises

- **Clothing Style:** During heists: form-fitting black attire with specialized equipment. In public: varies with disguises, but tends toward understated elegance that allows them to blend into any environment.  
- **Defining Features:** Moves with unusual grace and silence. Always wears thin leather gloves, even in social settings. Has a small, barely noticeable scar at the corner of their right eye.  

### Personality

- **Strengths:** Exceptional situational awareness, photographic memory, masterful at disguise and mimicry, expert in security systems and locks.  
- **Weaknesses:** Pride in never leaving evidence sometimes leads to unnecessarily complex methods. Has a weakness for puzzles and challenges that can draw them into risky situations. Holds personal grudges against certain families in high society.  
- **Habits & Quirks:** Leaves a calling card at the scene of major heists—a small origami shadow figure. Studies targets for weeks before making a move. Often returns to the scene of a crime disguised as a bystander to observe the aftermath.  

### Relationships
- **Family:** Claims to be the disinherited half-brother of Evelyn Dupont, though this connection is kept hidden from public knowledge  
- **Friends & Allies:** A small network of assistants with specialized skills—a forger, a fence, an information broker, and a former security expert  
- **Enemies & Rivals:** The city's wealthy elite, particularly the Dupont family; the detective Samuel Blackwood; certain ambitious police officers  
- **Romantic Interests:** Rumored to have had a relationship with a prominent socialite, though this may be just another carefully constructed disguise  

### Belongings
- Custom lockpicking tools disguised as ordinary items
- Collection of impeccably crafted disguises and falsified identity documents
- The stolen Dupont heirloom (currently)
- A small book containing handwritten notes about potential targets and their security measures

### Additional Notes
The Shadow's vendetta against the Dupont family stems from a legitimate claim to part of their fortune and heritage. Rather than purely criminal intent, their thefts often contain an element of reclaiming what they consider rightfully theirs. They possess an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's architecture, including hidden passages and forgotten tunnels that allow them to move unseen throughout even the most secure areas.
